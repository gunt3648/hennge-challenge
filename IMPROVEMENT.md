# Improvements
My suggestion on the desktop design are:
  - Hide the To column to increase more space of the Subject column
  - Disable sort function and implement a search function instead
  - Add a date picker for the date range filter
  - Highlight unread emails
  - Show a clip icon on the right of the mail subject is hard to notice. It may displays the files name under the subject instead

My suggestion on the mobile design are:
  - Too much detail. We may hide the To row
  - Change date range search to subject search
