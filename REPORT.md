To complete the missions, I divided into 5 steps which are:
  - Planning and initializing project. Starting from selecting a framework, then I selected the part to do first.
  - Building UI of the web page: filter bar -> mail box -> mail component - 7 hours
  - Implementing features: fetching data -> filtering -> sorting  - 4 hours
  - Extending the UI: Allowing users to inspect the body by displaying in the mail component - 1 hours
  - Adding responsive design - 2 hours

The total time: 14 hours
